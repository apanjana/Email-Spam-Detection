Spam Email Detection Using Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm

This project is on Spam Email Detection using Naive Bayes Algorithm.

The dataset file contains the dataset on the spam emails. Out of the two columns, the "Message" column contains the mail messages and the column "Category" denotes whether the corresponding message is a 'ham' or a 'spam'.

The datasets are first converted into dataframes and preprocessing is done to convert the text formats of the dataframe to numerical formats. 
A model is then created using the dataframe and trained into the Naive Bayes Algorithm. 
Output is then predicted.
